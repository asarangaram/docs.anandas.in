## Tasks
There are numerous tasks that require intelligence, and consequently, cognitive functions.

Machines can be programmed (using algorithms) to execute cognitive functions based on rules and heuristics, and they excel when the required intelligence is at a low level or is repetitive.

There are two kinds of tasks that require a high level of intelligence: discriminative tasks and creative tasks. 

=== "Analytical Tasks - examples"

	- Understanding and interpreting human language from text or speech - Natural Language Processing
	- Image recognition (identifying objects or patterns in images), object tracking (following the movement of objects in videos), and image segmentation (dividing an image into meaningful segments) - Computer Vision
	- Inspecting products for defects, measuring dimensions, reading labels or barcodes, and guiding robots in assembly lines - Machine Vision
	- Path planning, object manipulation, and decision-making based on sensory input - Robotics, autonomous vehicles
    
=== "Creative Tasks - examples"

	- Creating/writing text in a human-like manner - Translation, Q&A, summarization 
	- Converting audio signals into text - Automatic Speech Recognition
	- Engaging in conversation like a human, narrating stories with emotion 
	- Describing images/videos/music in text, or generating images/videos/music based on the description 
	- Discovering new drugs 
	- Creating new music compositions


For these tasks, a data-driven or analytical approach is preferred. The machines have limited ability to perform the analytical approach, but they can excel at the data-driven approach due to their capacity to process large quantities of data.

The data-driven approach constitutes the cornerstone in Machine Learning when constructing Artificial Intelligence.
