## Approaches

The cognitive functions may be performed either by Rule-based, Data-driven, Heuristic-based or Analytical or approach or combination of all these approaches.

1. Rule-based - based on clear and set rules or conditions.
2. Data-driven - by studying and analysing data.
3. Heuristic-based - using 'mental shortcuts' without having to carefully consider all possible options.
4. Analytical - by carefully studying all available information, which may include numbers, expert opinions, and formal evaluation processes.

!!! note
	 The boundaries between these approaches can sometimes be flexible, as they are all connected. This classification is simply for understanding and organizing the concepts.


Machines are capable of emulating all of these approaches, although they may not replicate the depth of human capability. While machines can perform advanced data analysis and statistical processing, they do so using algorithms and predefined procedures, rather than employing human-like analytical reasoning. However, machines can mimic rule-based, heuristic, and data-driven approaches much more effectively than humans.
