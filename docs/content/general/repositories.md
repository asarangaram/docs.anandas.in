# Open Source Repositories with useful implementations

## Riverpod
A state-management library for Dart and Flutter

## Photo-to-Cross-Stitch

An Image processing library, to reduce the number of colors in an image.

This project takes a photo as input, and creates a cross-stitch needlework pattern as output with the specified number of colors and canvas background color.

## Photo Simplification

An Image processing library, to reduce the number of colors in an image.

Uses a K-Means Clustering approach to simplify a photo into the average K most used colors.

## Facial Detection

to get the name of file that contains most compareable (similar) photos as of test image using OpenCV and KNN.

https://github.com/Ankuraxz/Facial_Detection_using_OpenCV_and_KNN

## Face Recognition (Python Package)

claims  "__Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world's simplest face recognition library.__"

## Photo Cluster | Rate 1/5

Photo Clusterring using KMean.

https://github.com/HinataAoki/Photo_Cluster

Its a very basic implementation, using the resized grey image (300, 200) as feature and fit into model

`model = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters).fit(feature)` 

them copy the files into group, and also create a mean image for each lable.

Finding some issues with the way the extensions are handled. Seems incomplete work.
