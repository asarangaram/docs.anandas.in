| **Number of Ideas**            | One complete idea.                                              | Two complete ideas.                                                     | One main idea + one extra (dependent) idea.                                                        |
| **Number of Verbs**            | Usually one main verb.                                          | Two main verbs (one for each idea).                                     | Two verbs (one for the main idea, one for the extra idea).                                         |
| **Conjunctions**               | Can use conjunctions (like "and" for lists), but not required.  | Must use a conjunction (like FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). | Uses special conjunctions (like because, if, when, although) for the extra idea.                   |
| **Examples with Conjunctions** | "I like cats and dogs." (One verb: "like," joining a list.)     | "I like cats, and she likes dogs." (Two verbs: "like" and "likes.")     | "I like cats because she likes dogs." (Main: "like," Extra: "likes.")                              |
| **Subject**                    | One subject doing the action.                                   | Two subjects (can be same or different).                                | One main subject, plus an extra subject in the dependent part.                                     |
| **Can Stand Alone?**           | Yes, it’s complete by itself.                                   | Each part could stand alone as a separate sentence.                     | Main idea can stand alone; extra idea cannot.                                                      |
| **Comma Use**                  | No comma needed before conjunction (if used).                   | Comma usually comes before the conjunction.                             | Comma depends: often after the extra idea if it comes first (e.g., "Because I’m tired, I sleep."). |
| **Example**                    | "I run and jump." (One idea, verbs "run" and "jump" as a list.) | "I run, but she jumps." (Two ideas, verbs "run" and "jumps.")           | "I run because she jumps." (Main: "I run," Extra: "because she jumps.")                            |
