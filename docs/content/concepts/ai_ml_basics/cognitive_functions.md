## Cognitive Functions
Let us understand the congitive functions.

### Perceiving
Perceiving is the ability to be aware of, organise, and interpret information from the environment through sensors like cameras, mic, LiDAR, or touch sensors and making it available for remaining cognitive functions.

	To build machines or AI systems with the capability to smell and taste is a considerably more complex task that is still in the research phase. Olfactory sensors and gustatory sensors are employed to detect and identify smells and tastes, respectively.

### Learning
Learning refers to the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, or patterns and updating the existing knowledge in the form of parameters (states) or models based on the new information available.

### Reasoning
Reasoning is the ability to reach conclusions based on available information and predefined rules or models.

### Decision Making
Decision making is the process of selecting the most appropriate action or response based in the learning and reasoning. Decision making can be either rational or irrational, and it can be based on explicit or tacit knowledge and beliefs

### Problem Solving
 Problem solving is the process of finding effective solutions to specific challenges or obstacles by identifying the problem, searching and evaluating potential solutions, and implementing the best action.

!!! Note "Decision Making Vs Problem Solving"

    Problem solving is about generating new ideas or solutions, whereas decision making involves choosing the best option among existing ideas or alternatives.


### Language skill
The process of understanding and using language may also be considered as a separate cognitive function.
