title: Running a script without password

---

## Why do we need?
As part of automation of services, we need to issue certain commands as sudoer. 

One typical use case I came across is to restart the ngnix once the Hugo content is rebuild. In this case, if sudo requires password, we can't trigger it in script.

Making scripts to run with sudo password is a security risk, and assumption here is that the machine access is restricted and secure.

## How it can be done?

Open sudoers file for your user

```bash
$ sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myusername
```

update the commands that we want to call without sudo password as below. 
```
myusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service nginx start,/usr/sbin/service nginx stop,/usr/sbin/service nginx restart
```

we can add any script that is executable as root.
```
myusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/rootscript
```
