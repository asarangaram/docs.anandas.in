# Bayesian Statistics

* Based on the **Bayesian interpretation of probability**
* Probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. 
* The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event.
* use **Bayes' theorem** to compute and update probabilities after obtaining new data

## Bayes' theorem

Stated mathematically as below,

${P(A\vert B)={\frac {P(B\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}}}$

$P(A\vert B)$ 
: The probability of event $A$ occurring given that $B$ is true. 
: Conditional probability 
: Posterior probability of $A$ given $B$

$P(B\vert A)$ 
: The probability of event $B$ occurring given that $A$ is true. 
: $likelihood$ of $A$ given a fixed $B$ because $P(B|A)=L(A|B)$ 

$P(A)$ and $P(B)$
: The probabilities of observing A and B respectively without any given conditions
Prior Probability / Marginal Probability
