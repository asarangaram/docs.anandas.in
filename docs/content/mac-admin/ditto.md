# Ditto

A command line tool on MAC

Copy directory hierarchies, create and extract archives. Ditto can preserve ownership / permissions, resource forks and file / folder metadata. Ditto will automatically create the destination folder if it doesnâ€™t yet exist, if the destination does exist and contains files, then ditto will **merge** them.
