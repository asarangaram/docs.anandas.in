Activeloop, Towards AI, and Intel® Disruptor Initiative are excited to collaborate to bring Gen AI 360: Foundational Model Certification Course to aspiring Generative AI professionals, executives, and enthusiasts of tomorrow.

Following the success of our **"LangChain & Vector Databases In Production"** course, we're excited to welcome you to part two of the series, "Training and Fine-tuning LLMs for Production." In this course, you will cover the intricacies of training, fine-tuning, and seamlessly integrating these models into AI products. This course will guide you on the most effective methods and best practices for preparing LLMs for production. Let's begin!
Why This Course?

The “Training and Fine-tuning LLMs for Production” course provides the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to work with these models.

A fundamental pillar of our course is hands-on learning. We are grounded in the belief that practical application and experimentation form the cornerstone of truly understanding and utilizing the strengths of LLMs.

You will acquire the skills to train, refine, and adapt LLMs for specific tasks and integrate them seamlessly into your products and applications.

We navigate deeper to understand the complex layers of LLMs, touching upon the architectural frameworks of Transformers and GPT models. We also explore the metrics used for performance evaluation, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the whole process involved in gearing LLMs for production.
Who Should Take This Course?

This course is designed with a wide audience in mind, including beginners in AI, current machine learning engineers, students, and professionals considering a career transition to AI. Please know that prior knowledge of coding and Python is a prerequisite.

We aim to provide you with the necessary tools to apply and tailor Large Language Models across a wide range of industries to make AI more accessible and practical. 
What You Will Learn

As we progress, you'll become familiar with the architecture of Transformers and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and learn more about prompting LLMs to produce specific outputs. Essential topics such as proprietary versus open-source models, various LLM training methodologies, and production deployment strategies will be covered. We also touch upon advanced fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, SFT, and RLHF.

As the course progresses, you'll engage in several projects crafted to offer you hands-on experience while reinforcing your grasp of LLMs.

One standout project will guide you through the process of Supervised Fine-Tuning focused on financial sentiment analysis. Here, you'll become adept at various strategies for refining LLMs and get a clear perspective on datasets designed for tailoring LLMs to specific, goal-oriented tasks.
## Is the Course Free?

Yes, the course is entirely free for everybody.
Estimated cost of running the code examples in the course

Running the code examples in the course may require additional costs, but please note that this is not a requirement for course completion.

This course includes multiple coding projects, including one on pre-training a language model using Lambda Labs GPUs, another on fine-tuning an LLM on GPUs through RLHF, and additional ones on fine-tuning LLMs on CPUs. We made an effort to keep the costs low so that more students could easily replicate them. You can still complete the course and pass chapter quizzes without running these projects or paying anything.

The main cost, of course, would be the pre-training of the language model (so, GPUs), but you can start it and stop it after a few iterations, spending a few dollars just for the experience of setting up the infrastructure. Expect to spend something between $50 and $100, if you wish to complete the fine-tuning examples. Always beware of the costs you're incurring when you borrow AI hardware (GPUs or CPUs with a lot of RAM), and make sure not to use them for more time than necessary.

For CPUs renting, we use Google Cloud Platform which give free credits of the value of 300$ to be used in three months after signup. These free credits can be used with Compute Engine to rent CPUs. We explain how to do that in a later section.
Will platform and cloud credits be available for students of the course?

We will also be providing grants and credits in collaboration with our partners to complete the training or fine-tuning examples. Everyone will get free access to Deep Lake for the course but some other credits will only be available according to certain criteria and course completion milestones.

    Go to https://cloud.google.com/ and click on ‘TRY IT FREE‘.
    Login to your Gmail account, choose your country and accept the terms & conditions.
    Fill in: Account type, Name, Address, credit card details, tax information, etc (If you have an old Gmail account and all the information is already there, it would take it, and you might not have to fill in all the details).
    Click on “Start my free trial“.

Note: Credit Card is a must to create a Google Cloud Platform account.

You’ll be given free credits of the value of 300$ that you can use to experiment with the platform.

Here are some instructions on how to create a GCP project using the gcloud command line tool (follow these instructions to install it). Alternatively, you can create a project using the UI of the platform.

    Initiating the gcloud CLI: Initialize the Command Line Interface specific to Google Cloud, termed as 'gcloud,’ by executing the gcloud init command.
    Google Cloud Project Management:
        If you intend to use GCP temporarily, setting up a new Google Cloud project is recommended. This ensures that after evaluation, you can efficiently delete the project, subsequently removing all linked resources.
        To initiate a new Google Cloud project, input gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID, replacing 'PROJECT_ID' with a unique name for your project.
        To choose the recently created Google Cloud project, enter the command gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID.
    Billing Setup: For comprehensive details and guidelines on this, you can refer to their official documentation at cloud.google.com.

Once you have a GCP project, it’s possible to create a Compute Engine instance by searching for “Compute Engine” in the search bar on top of the page and then clicking on the “Compute Engine” search result. We’ll need a Compute Engine instance later in the course, so for now just read these instructions without executing them. Keep in mind that you’ll use your credits whenever you keep a VM on, so always remember to delete the instance once you’re done with your work.

To create a Compute Engine instance, you can then click on the “Create Instance” button and choose a machine configuration. In the course we’ll use high-end Intel® CPUs, which means the “C3” option from the list.
